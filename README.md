# htmllint.github.io

## Getting Started

As always, make sure you get the dependencies for this project:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Afterwards, you should be able to use the following `gulp` tasks:

```sh
# run this while developing to build, watch, and preview the site
$ gulp dev # or just gulp
# run this to deploy the site to htmllint.github.io
$ gulp deploy
# if you just want to build the files
$ gulp build
```

# Rules

The following are a set of rules for contributing, team meetings, and team conduct.

## Contributing

* All source files must pass JSHint. You can easily get a lint report by running
`gulp lint`.
* Write test code. We are aiming for 100% test coverage.

## Team Meetings and Conduct

The following rules only apply if you are a part of the team.

* Communication can be done via facebook or email. Phone calls should only be used
in emergencies (when responses are needed immediately).
* If you are going to miss a meeting, you must notify the rest of the team before
the day of the meeting. If you fail to notify the team before the day of the meeting,
you will have to take notes at the next meeting.
* If you miss any deadline, you must explain why.
  * If the deadline is a **large** one, you will be required to take the rest of the
  team out to dinner and pay for everyone (you also have very little choice in where
  the team chooses to go out to dinner).
  * If the deadline is a **small** one, then steps to get the project back on track
  will be discussed at the next meeting.
